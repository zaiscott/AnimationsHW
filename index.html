What this funtion  does is takes the data and transforms it in many different ways you see fit.</ol></li><li>.duration()<ol> allows you to have control over how long a transition may take. </ol></li><li>.ease()<ol> allows you to exhibit a more plausible motion in the transition with your data.</ol></li> <li>.delay()<ol> lets you control the time for when the trasnition will begin.</ol></li>
